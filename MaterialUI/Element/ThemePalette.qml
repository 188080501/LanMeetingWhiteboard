       A version of the accent color specifically for lighter or darker backgrounds. This is
       normally the same as the global \l Theme::accentColor, but for some application's color
       schemes, the accent color is too dark or too light  and a lighter/darker version is needed
       for some surfaces. This can be customized via the \l ApplicationWindow::theme group property.
       According to the Material Design guidelines, this should taken from a second color palette
       that complements the primary color palette at
